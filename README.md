# Reimann Visualizer
This is a GUI tool to visualize reimann sums and how the different parts of their composition can affect the final area in the rectangles.

I truly do not recommend using this for anything serious because of the sheer amount of bugs and bad code in here. I'm only finalizing it right now because this is made for a calculus 2 class extra-credit assignment and they aren't a stickler on the bugs.
